# Dapi's Takehome task
This repo contains the two takehome tasks that implements a login page using two different methods: 
1. Webscraping
2. Post Request

I was uanble to test my implementations using my ADCB Personal Internet Banking credentials because I am in the middle of resolving some issue regarding my bank account. However, I did my best to work around it. You will find each implementation in the corresponding folders. Please read the README.md files before you run anything

Thank you!!!
